# Vedinc Launchpad

## Project Overview

Vedinc Launchpad is a full-stack web application designed to serve as a structured platform for launching, managing, or showcasing projects and user interactions. The application is divided into a frontend interface and a backend server, ensuring clean separation of concerns and scalability.

This repository contains both the frontend and backend components required to run the application locally or deploy it to a production environment.

---

## Architecture and Components

The project follows a client-server architecture and is structured into two primary parts:

### 1. Frontend

The frontend is responsible for:

* Rendering the user interface
* Handling user interactions
* Managing routing and navigation
* Communicating with backend APIs
* Managing client-side state
* Handling form validation and submission

It is built using TypeScript and modern web technologies. The frontend communicates with the backend using HTTP requests.

---

### 2. Backend

The backend handles:

* API endpoint creation
* Business logic implementation
* Database interactions (if configured)
* Authentication and authorization
* Data validation and processing

The backend exposes RESTful APIs that the frontend consumes to retrieve and manipulate data.

---

## Features

* Structured frontend and backend separation
* API-driven architecture
* Modular and scalable project structure
* Clean and maintainable codebase
* Ready for deployment with environment configuration

(Add specific features such as authentication, dashboards, data management, etc., based on your implementation.)

---

## Technologies Used

Frontend:

* TypeScript
* CSS
* (React / Next.js / Angular / other framework if applicable)

Backend:

* Node.js
* Express.js (if used)
* Database integration (MongoDB / PostgreSQL / Supabase / etc., if applicable)

Package Management:

* npm

(Add or modify technologies based on your actual `package.json` files.)

## Installation and Setup

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Simeen19/vedinc-launchpad-main.git
cd vedinc-launchpad-main
```

---

### Install Frontend Dependencies

```
npm install
```

If the backend is inside a separate folder:

```
cd vedinc-backend
npm install
```

---

## Running the Application

### Start the Backend Server

Navigate to the backend directory:

```
cd vedinc-backend
npm run dev
```

This typically starts the server at:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

(Adjust the port based on your configuration.)

---

### Start the Frontend Application

From the root frontend directory:

```
npm start
```

This typically runs on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Environment Variables

If the application uses environment variables, create a `.env` file in the appropriate directory and configure:

* PORT
* DATABASE_URL or DB_URI
* JWT_SECRET (if authentication is implemented)
* API_BASE_URL (for frontend)

Ensure environment variables are not committed to version control.

---

## API Structure (Example)

Below is a sample API structure. Replace with actual endpoints from your backend.

| Endpoint        | Method | Description        |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| /api/users      | GET    | Retrieve all users |
| /api/auth/login | POST   | Authenticate user  |
| /api/items      | POST   | Create new item    |
| /api/items/:id  | DELETE | Delete item        |

---

## Deployment

To deploy the project:

1. Host the backend on platforms such as Render, Railway, or Heroku.
2. Host the frontend on Vercel, Netlify, or similar platforms.
3. Configure environment variables in the hosting dashboard.
4. Update the frontend API base URL to point to the deployed backend server.
